In this project you will be using the concepts learned in the Git for Web Development lesson to fork/clone/push/and submit a PR for this challenge.

This project consists of two tasks:

## Task 1: Set Up The Project With Git
Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:

- [ ] Create your own version of this repo - Fork (Create a forked copy of this project.)
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Codebits' by mistake!).
- [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b firstName-lastName.
- [ ] Implement the project on your newly created <firstName-lastName> branch, committing changes regularly.
- [ ] Run your usual git commands for adding/committing and pushing **Be sure to push to your branch!**
- [ ] Push commits: git push origin <firstName-lastName>.


## Task 2: Finished Project
1. Add HTML and CSS to make the index page in the repo look like the example: https://codebitsacademy-labtask4.netlify.app/  - note that you can change the colours but everything else must look the same
2. Include the link to the completed project on Github Pages in the space provided at the top of this README.md file.
2. Don't forget to add, commit and push your changes.

## Submission
- [ ] Create a Pull-Request to submit your work (Add your instructor(obahphemmy) as reviewer)
- [ ] Use your own student fork as the base (compare across forks, base-fork -> main).
